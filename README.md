Module 4 Challenge

This repository contains two folders: PyCitySchools, which contains the Jupyter Source File with the code and analysis, and Resources, which contains the two CSV files that were utilized as our data. The written report is found at the end of the Jupyter Source File, PyCitySchools. This README file is the third part of the repository.

The starter code that was provided by the instructional staff was used to aid the completion of this challenge.
